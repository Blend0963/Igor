# Changelog

## 0.1.4 — Memory is not the present

- Timestamp every conversation-history message and every semantically recalled message sent to the model, so memories read as past events rather than the current state of the home.
- Add "MEMORY IS NOT THE PRESENT" rules to the written and voice system prompts: never assert device state from a memory, verify the live state with get_state / search_entities, and treat "do it again" as a fresh command to execute now.
- Recognize French transient-state and command-echo statements ("a été allumée", "actuellement", "vient d'être éteinte") as garbage facts; the periodic cleanup job purges them retroactively.

## 0.1.3 — Mistral BYOK chat provider

- Add `mistral` to the add-on's bring-your-own-key provider choices (port of upstream Nives PR #107).
- Map Mistral chat to the OpenAI-compatible client: official `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` endpoint with `mistral-small-latest` as the default model.
- Omit `stream_options` for Mistral, which rejects that OpenAI-specific request field.
- Treat HTTP 422 reasoning-parameter validation errors as unsupported and withhold non-`none` Thinking Effort values from Mistral endpoints.

## 0.1.1 – 0.1.2 — Shared conversation and Mistral content fixes

- Use one persistent conversation across Assist devices and days, with semantic recall (embeddings and cosine similarity) of older stored history (#2).
- Handle structured content blocks in streamed model responses and normalize them during fact extraction (#3).

## 0.1.0 — MaDo initial release

- Establish MaDo branding and Home Assistant add-on metadata.
- Default new installations to bring-your-own-key model configuration.
- Add optional Mistral native web search with source URLs and excerpts.
- Preserve Home Assistant tools, automation confirmation flow, persistent memory, and conversation history.
- Retain the AGPL-3.0 license and upstream copyright/attribution notices.
