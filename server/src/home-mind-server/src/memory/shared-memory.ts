/**
 * One memory for the household (nives#65).
 *
 * Facts are stored per user id, and until 2.7.0 the integration picked that id
 * per caller: a voice satellite (no Home Assistant user behind the request)
 * wrote to the configured id, while the dashboard and the companion app wrote
 * to each person's own Home Assistant user id. One install quietly kept two or
 * more memories that could not see each other, and nothing said so: it read
 * as memory loss rather than routing.
 *
 * The integration now uses one configured id for everyone by default. This
 * module carries the two server halves of that change:
 *
 *  - an info line the first time a request lands on an empty bucket while
 *    another bucket holds facts, so a split that remains (shared memory turned
 *    off, or an API caller choosing its own ids) takes minutes to diagnose
 *    instead of days;
 *  - a one-time, non-destructive merge that copies the facts older versions
 *    wrote into per-user buckets into the shared one.
